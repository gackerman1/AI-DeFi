 ## Create Your Dashboard
 
 ### Step 1:
If you don't already have one, create a Dune Analytics account for free at [dune.xyz](https://dune.xyz) and set up your profile. 

 
 ### Step 2:
Browse the available queries and dashboards and begin to build your own either by modifying existing queries or building fully customized queries.  A good introduction and tutorials on the visualizations and tools available through Dune can be found at [docs.dune.xyz](https://docs.dune.xyz/)

### Step 3: 

For our test run, we are only interested in 4-hourly data from precisely 2019-01-01 00:00:00 - 2022-01-13 11:59:59.  In the next test round, you'll be able to choose your own dependent variables.  

Below is an example of a query built to look at Uniswap volume over a 7-day time frame. You can view or modify this query [*here*](https://dune.xyz/embeds/350914/667614/da7d8814-6667-44a5-9975-11bca5bd79b9)

And its corresponding chart:

### Step 3:
Once you have graphs, they can be aggregated into a dashboard. Click “Create” -> “New Dashboard” and give your dashboard an informative name. Widgets can be added with the “Add Widget” button in the dashboard panel, or with the “Add to Dashboard” button in each visualization in each query.
